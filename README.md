# Analytics-Dashboard-Script
The "Performance Analytics Dashboard" script is designed to fetch and process JSON data from an analytics API within a Google Sheets environment. It provides various functions for importing JSON data based on different HTTP methods (GET and POST), handling basic authentication, OAuth configuration, and querying specific data ranges. It supports dynamic URL construction based on dates fetched from a designated sheet, and it includes utilities for parsing JSON responses into structured data arrays suitable for analysis and visualization. The script is tailored for automating the retrieval and presentation of performance metrics and analytics data directly within Google Sheets.
